The files:

- `params_input.dat`
- `semi_input.dat`

located inside this folder are examples of working input parameters files
and can be copied or moved to the root folder (where `asteca.py` is located)
to be used by the code.

**Important**: a properly formatted `params_input.dat` file should always be
present in the root folder for **ASteCA** to work.

This folder and its contents can be safely deleted.
